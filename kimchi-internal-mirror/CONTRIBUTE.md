How to Contribute
=================

All development discussion happens on the mailing list.  All development is done
using the `git` SCM. Patches should be sent using the `git send-email` command
to the kimchi-devel@ovirt.org mailing list.

Good examples of how to send patches are included in
[QEMU SubmitAPatch](http://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch) and
[Linux SubmittingPatches](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches).

All documentation and READMEs are written using
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

For a patch to be committed, it must receive at least one "Reviewed-by" on the
mailing list.
